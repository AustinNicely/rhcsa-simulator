# RHCSA Mock Exam Simulator

A realistic command-line RHCSA (Red Hat Certified System Administrator) exam simulator that generates exam tasks, validates your system configuration, and tracks your progress over time.

## Features

### Learning Modes
- **Learn Mode**: Study RHCSA concepts with detailed explanations, command syntax, examples, common mistakes, and exam tricks
- **Guided Practice**: Practice tasks with progressive 3-level hints (concept → command structure → full solution)
- **Command Recall Training**: Build muscle memory by typing commands before execution with instant accuracy feedback

### Testing Modes
- **Full Exam Mode**: Simulates a complete RHCSA exam with 15-20 tasks covering all objectives
- **Practice Mode**: Focus on specific categories (Users, LVM, SELinux, etc.) at different difficulty levels

### Core Features
- **Automatic Validation**: Validates your system configuration using safe, read-only commands
- **Adaptive Feedback**: Explains what was expected vs. what was found for each failed check
- **Progress Tracking**: Saves exam results and displays statistics over time
- **Timer Support**: Optional 2.5-hour timer to simulate real exam conditions
- **Offline Operation**: No internet connection required
- **Safe & Secure**: Uses command whitelisting and validation-only approach

### AI-Powered Feedback (Optional)
- **Intelligent Analysis**: Line-by-line command analysis using Claude AI
- **Smart Explanations**: Understands WHY you failed, not just that you failed
- **Approach Comparison**: Compares your solution to optimal approaches
- **Contextual Tips**: RHCSA exam tips personalized to each task
- **Command Tracking**: Automatically tracks and categorizes commands you execute

**Setup**: See [AI_SETUP.md](AI_SETUP.md) for configuration instructions (requires Anthropic API key)

## Requirements

- **OS**: RHEL 8/9, Rocky Linux 8/9, or Alma Linux 8/9
- **Python**: 3.6 or later (included in RHEL 8/9)
- **Privileges**: Must run as root (uses `sudo`)
- **Dependencies**: None (uses Python standard library only)

## Installation

- Recent exam results
- Performance by category

## Recommended Learning Path

For best results, follow this progression:

1. **Learn** - Study each topic with Learn Mode
   - Understand concepts before practicing
   - Review command syntax and examples
   - Learn common mistakes and exam tricks

2. **Guided Practice** - Build confidence with hints
   - Start practicing tasks with support
   - Use hints when stuck
   - Learn from adaptive feedback

3. **Command Recall** - Build muscle memory
   - Practice typing commands from memory
   - Improve speed and accuracy
   - Build exam-day confidence

4. **Practice Mode** - Test without hints
   - Validate your knowledge independently
   - Identify weak areas
   - Build problem-solving skills

5. **Exam Mode** - Full exam simulation
   - Take complete timed exams
   - Simulate real exam pressure
   - Track your progress over time

**Pro Tip**: Cycle through topics rather than mastering one at a time. This improves retention and helps you see connections between different RHCSA objectives.

## Task Categories

The simulator covers all RHCSA exam objectives:

1. **Essential Tools** - find, grep, tar, archives
2. **Users & Groups** - user/group management, sudo
3. **Permissions** - chmod, chown, ACLs, special bits
4. **LVM** - physical volumes, volume groups, logical volumes
5. **File Systems** - create, mount, fstab, XFS, ext4
6. **Networking** - interface configuration, DNS, hostnames
7. **SELinux** - contexts, booleans, modes
8. **Services** - systemd service management
9. **Boot Targets** - multi-user, graphical targets
10. **Processes** - process management, priorities
11. **Scheduling** - cron, at, systemd timers
12. **Containers** - Podman basics

## Example Tasks

### User Management
```
Task: Create a user named 'examuser42' with the following requirements:
  - UID: 2500
  - Primary group: developers
  - Supplementary groups: wheel, sysadmin
  - Home directory: /home/examuser42
  - Login shell: /bin/bash
```

### SELinux
```
Task: Configure SELinux context for directory '/srv/web01':
  - Set SELinux type to: httpd_sys_content_t
  - Apply context recursively to all files
  - Make the change persistent across relabels
```

### Services
```
Task: Configure the 'httpd' service:
  - Start the service
  - Enable the service to start at boot
```

## How It Works

### Validation Process

The simulator uses **read-only validation**:
- Does NOT modify your system
- Only checks if tasks were completed correctly
- Uses safe, whitelisted commands (`id`, `ls`, `systemctl status`, etc.)
- All commands have timeout protection
- Command injection prevention

### Scoring

- Each task has a point value (4-12 points typically)
- Tasks have multiple validation checks
- Partial credit is awarded for partial completion
- Pass threshold: 70% (configurable)

### Results Storage

Results are saved to JSON files in `/opt/rhcsa-simulator/data/results/`:
- Exam ID and timestamp
- Task-by-task results
- Category breakdown
- Total score and pass/fail status

```

## Extending the Simulator

### Adding New Tasks

1. Open the appropriate category file (e.g., `tasks/users_groups.py`)
2. Create a new class extending `BaseTask`
3. Register with `@TaskRegistry.register("category_name")`
4. Implement `generate()` and `validate()` methods

Example:

```python
@TaskRegistry.register("users_groups")
class MyNewTask(BaseTask):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            id="my_task_001",
            category="users_groups",
            difficulty="exam",
            points=8
        )

    def generate(self, **params):
        self.description = "Task description here"
        self.hints = ["Hint 1", "Hint 2"]
        return self

    def validate(self):
        checks = []
        # Add validation checks
        return ValidationResult(self.id, passed, score, max_score, checks)
```

## Security

- **Command Whitelisting**: Only approved read-only commands
- **Timeout Protection**: All commands have 5-second timeout
- **Pattern Blocking**: Detects dangerous patterns (rm -rf, etc.)
- **No System Modifications**: Validation is read-only
- **Root Required**: Needed to check system state, not to modify it

## Troubleshooting

### "Must run as root" error
```bash
sudo rhcsa-simulator  # Don't forget sudo!
```

### Module import errors
```bash
# Ensure you're in the correct directory
cd /opt/rhcsa-simulator
sudo python3 rhcsa_simulator.py
```

### No tasks available
- Run `sudo rhcsa-simulator` to initialize task registry
- Check logs at `/opt/rhcsa-simulator/data/logs/rhcsa_simulator.log`

## Development

### Project Stats
- **Lines of Code**: ~5,500
- **Task Categories**: 12
- **Task Types**: 20+ implemented, expandable to 100+
- **Validators**: 50+ validation functions
- **Dependencies**: 0 (Python stdlib only)

### Testing Tasks

```python
# Run from project root
cd /opt/rhcsa-simulator
sudo python3 -c "
from tasks.registry import TaskRegistry
TaskRegistry.initialize()
TaskRegistry.print_statistics()
"
```

## Contributing

To add more tasks:
1. Choose a category or create a new one
2. Follow the pattern in `tasks/users_groups.py`
3. Use existing validators from `validators/` modules
4. Test thoroughly on a test system
